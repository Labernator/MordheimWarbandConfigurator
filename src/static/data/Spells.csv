Magic of the Horned Rat;Warpfire;8;The spell has a range of 8", hitting the first model in its path. The spell causes D3 Strength 4 hits on its target, and one Strength 3 hit on each model within 2" of the target.
Magic of the Horned Rat;Children of the Horned Rat;0;This spell must be used before the game, and may only be used once. When cast, the spell summons D3 Giant Rats, which are placed within 6" of the Sorcerer. The Sorcerer may cast this spell successfully only once per battle, and the rats disappear after the battle. They do not count towards the maximum size of the Skaven warband.
Magic of the Horned Rat;Gnawdoom;7;The Gnawdoom causes 2D6 Strength 1 hits on a single model within 8" of the caster.
Magic of the Horned Rat;Black Fury;8;The Sorcerer may immediately charge any enemy model within 12" (ignoring any terrain and interposing models) and gains 2 extra Attacks and +1 Strength during this turn’s hand-to-hand combat phase only.
Magic of the Horned Rat;Eye of the Warp;8;All standing models in base contact with the Sorcerer must take an immediate Leadership test. If they fail, they each suffer a Strength 3 hit and must run 2D6" directly away from the Sorcerer, exactly as if they had lost their nerve when fighting against more than one opponent.
Magic of the Horned Rat;Sorcerer’s Curse;6;The spell has a range of 12" and affects a single model within range. The target must re-roll any successful armour savesand to hit rolls during the Skaven hand-to-hand phase and his own next shooting and hand-to-hand combat phases
Prayers of Sigmar;The Hammer of Sigmar;7;The wielder gains +2 Strength in hand-to-hand combat and all hits he inflicts cause double damage (e.g., 2 wounds instead of 1). The Priest must test each shooting phase he wants to use the Hammer.
Prayers of Sigmar;Hearts of Steel;8;Any allied warriors within 8" of the warrior become immune to Fear and All Alone tests. In addition, the whole warband gains +1 to any Rout tests they have to make. The effects of this spell last until the caster is knocked down, stunned or put out of action. If cast again the effects are not cumulative, i.e., the maximum bonus to Rout tests remains +1.
Prayers of Sigmar;Soulfire;9;All enemy models within 4" of the servant of Sigmar suffer a Strength 3 hit. No armour saves are allowed. Undead and Possessed models in range suffer a Strength 5 hit instead.
Prayers of Sigmar;Shield of Faith;6;The Priest is immune to all spells. Roll at the beginning of each turn in the recovery phase. On a roll of 1 or 2 the shield disappears.
Prayers of Sigmar;Healing Hand;5;Any one model within 2" of the Priest (including himself) may be healed. The warrior is restored to his full quota of Wounds. In addition, if any friendly models within 2" are stunned or knocked down, they immediately come to their senses, stand up, and continue fighting as normal.
Prayers of Sigmar;Armour of Righteousness;9;The Priest has an armour save of 2+ which replaces his normal armour save. In addition, he causes fear in his enemies and is therefore immune to fear himself. The power of the Armour of Righteousness lasts until the beginning of the Priest’s next Shooting phase.
Necromancy;Lifestealer;10;"You may choose a single model within 6"". The target suffers a wound (no save allowed) and the Necromancer gains an extra wound for the duration of the battle. This may take the Necromancer’s Wounds above his original maximum value. This spell will not affect the Possessed or any Undead models."
Necromancy;Re-Animation;5;"Place the model within 6"" of the Necromancer. The model cannot be placed straight into hand-to-hand combat with an enemy model."
Necromancy;Death Vision;6;The Necromancer causes fear in his enemies for the duration of the battle.
Necromancy;Spell of Doom;9;"Choose one enemy model within 12"". The model must immediately roll equal to or less than his Strength on a D6 or the dead emerging from the earth will rend him with supernatural power. If he fails, you may roll on the Injury table to see what happens to the unfortunate warrior."
Necromancy;Call of Vanhel;6;"A single Zombie or Dire Wolf within 6"" of the Necromancer may immediately move again up to its maximum Movement distance (ie, 9"" in the case of Dire Wolves). If this moves them into base contact with an enemy model, they count as charging."
Necromancy;Spell of Awakening;Auto;If an enemy Hero is killed (ie, your opponent rolls 11-16 on the Serious Injury chart after the battle) then the Necro- mancer may raise him to fight as a Zombie in his servitude. The dead Hero retains his characteristics and all his weapons and armour but may not use any other equipment or skills. He may no longer run, counts as a Henchman group on his own, and may not gain additional experience. This spell always succeeds (rules for Henchmen and experience are described later). The new Zombie follows all the normal Zombie rules (immune to poison, causes fear) except for retaining his profile, weapons and armour.
