Magic of the Horned Rat;Children of the Horned Rat;0;This spell must be used before the game, and may only be used once. When cast, the spell summons D3 Giant Rats, which are placed within 6" of the Sorcerer. The Sorcerer may cast this spell successfully only once per battle, and the rats disappear after the battle. They do not count towards the maximum size of the Skaven warband.

Magic of the Horned Rat;Black Fury;8;The Sorcerer may immediately charge any enemy model within 12" (ignoring any terrain and interposing models) and gains 2 extra Attacks and +1 Strength during this turn’s hand-to-hand combat phase only.
Magic of the Horned Rat;Eye of the Warp;8;All standing models in base contact with the Sorcerer must take an immediate Leadership test. If they fail, they each suffer a Strength 3 hit and must run 2D6" directly away from the Sorcerer, exactly as if they had lost their nerve when fighting against more than one opponent.
Magic of the Horned Rat;Sorcerer’s Curse;6;The spell has a range of 12" and affects a single model within range. The target must re-roll any successful armour savesand to hit rolls during the Skaven hand-to-hand phase and his own next shooting and hand-to-hand combat phases

Prayers of Sigmar;Hearts of Steel;8;Any allied warriors within 8" of the warrior become immune to Fear and All Alone tests. In addition, the whole warband gains +1 to any Rout tests they have to make. The effects of this spell last until the caster is knocked down, stunned or put out of action. If cast again the effects are not cumulative, i.e., the maximum bonus to Rout tests remains +1.
Prayers of Sigmar;Soulfire;9;All enemy models within 4" of the servant of Sigmar suffer a Strength 3 hit. No armour saves are allowed. Undead and Possessed models in range suffer a Strength 5 hit instead.

Prayers of Sigmar;Armour of Righteousness;9;The Priest has an armour save of 2+ which replaces his normal armour save. In addition, he causes fear in his enemies and is therefore immune to fear himself. The power of the Armour of Righteousness lasts until the beginning of the Priest’s next Shooting phase.
