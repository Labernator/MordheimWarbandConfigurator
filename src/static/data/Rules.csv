Large Target;Any model may shoot at this fighter, even if it is not the closest target.
Blessed Sight;An Augur can re-roll any failed characteristic tests (climbing, resisting spells or any other reason), and any rolls to hit in close combat or shooting. You must accept the second result. In addition, an Augur can use her Blessed Sight to help the Sisterhood when they are searching the city for wyrdstone. If the Augur is not put out of action in the battle, you may roll two dice for her in the exploration phase and pick either dice as the result.
No Armour;The warrior may not wear any armour.
Leader (12);Any warband member within 12" of this warrior may use its Leadership characteristic when taking any Leadership tests.
Inheritance;When the Kislevite warband is first created, the Druzhina Captain is allowed to purchase one item from the Kislevite Warrior equipment list at half the normal cost. If the item is ever lost (e.g., from a Robbed result on the Serious Injury chart), the Captain MUST replace it with a finely-made substitute as quickly as possible. To replace an ancestral item, the Captain must purchase the same item of equipment at 150% of its normal price. Until the item is replaced, the Captain suffers a -1 penalty to all tests and rolls to hit.
Bear Handler;Kislevite warband that includes a Bear Tamer is allowed to purchase a Bear as a henchman. This Bear has been trained to follow the Tamer's commands, and so will automatically pass its Stupidity tests when within 6" of the Bear Tamer (even if the Tamer has been knocked down or Stunned).
Gun Rest;If armed with both halberd and handgun, the Streletsi receives a + 1 on his 'to hit' roll with the handgun, as long as he did not move that turn (this applies even if the warrior has a skill that allows him to move & shoot with his handgun - he must not move if he is to rest the gun).
Trained;Trained Bears are subject to the rules for Stupidity. The bear is not required to take these stupidity tests if the warband's Bear Tamer is within 6". A Trained Rear will never use the warband leader's Leadership for any tests it is required to take. It may use the Bear Tamers Lead-ership if within 6" of him however. The Trained Bear will not take part in any game where the warband does not include a Bear Tamer.
Bear Hug;If the Bear hits the same enemy warrior with both of his attacks in the same round of combat, the player may choose to make a single 'Bear Hug' attack instead of resolving the attacks normally. If this option is chosen, each player must roll a D6 and add his model's Strength to the roll. If the Bear's total is higher or the totals are equal, the opposing warrior takes a single auto-matic wound with no armour save allowed. If the enemy warrior's total is higher, the warrior has broken the Bear's hold and suffers no damage from the attack.
Fiercerly Loyal;As long as his bear is not taken out of action during a game, a Bear Tamer ignores the following results on the Serious Injury table: 'Sold to the Pits', 'Robbed', and 'Captured' and treats them as ‘Full Recovery instead’.
Set Traps;"A Bergjaeger may set a trap if he spends a turn doing nothing else (he may not set traps if he’s just recovered from being knocked down). Place a marker in base contact with the Bergjager. When any model moves within 2"" of the mark- er, roll a D6. On a score of 3+ the model suffers a S4 hit (the Bergjager won’t trigger his own traps). If the target is knocked down or stunned it is placed within 2” of the marker. Regardless whether the trap was triggered or not, the marker is removed."
Promotion;When a Halfling is promoted to hero through the “The lad’s got talent” advance he may not choose Strength skills as one of his two skill lists.
Drunken;Roll a D6 at the start of each turn and consult the chart below: 1: The Centigor is subject to Stupidity for this turn, 2-5:  Nothing happens. , 6:  The Centigor is subject to Frenzy for this turn.
Woodland Dwelling;The Centigor never suffers movement penalties for moving through wooded areas.
Trample;The Centigor gains an additional attack, which does not benefit from weapon bonuses.
Lowest of the Low;If an Ungor rolls ‘That lad’s got talent’ it must be re-rolled.
Bloodgreed;If a Minotaur puts all of its enemies out of action in hand-to-hand combat, it be- comes subject to Frenzy (see the respective rule in the Leadership & Psychology section) on a D6 roll of 4+.
May not run;Unit may not run (but may charge as normal).
Immune To Psychology;Unit automatically pass any Leadership-based test they are re- quired to take.
Immune to Posion;Unit  is immune to any kind of poison.
No Brain;Unit never gain Experience.
No Pain;Unit treat a Stunned result on the Injury chart as knocked down.
